# Destiny-2-Armor-3.0-Calculator
This is a quick tool for Destiny 2's new Armor 3.0 system. I made it first to see If I could make my hunter have 100 in 5 stats other than weapons and wanted to mathematically calculate the possibility of that. After sharing this with a friend in private I thought I could maybe share this with other people as I would be happy to see it helping at least one person a little.

For you to find your desired archetype of armor with what type of mods you should use, it randomly creates thousands of armor combinations and uses heuristic search and greedy algorithms to find the perfect match for your desired stats. Its written on C++ for it to be fast so it might take a around 10 seconds at most.

It considers all armor is tier 5 and you don't use an exotic so keep that in mind.

The source code is given in the repository If anyone feels scared about the exe file. Still would recommend downloading the exe file as it contains basic mingw64 dll's to run the code.
(This is also why the exe file is bigger than the actual code)
